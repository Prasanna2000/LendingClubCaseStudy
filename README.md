## General Information

### The problem

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

### Solution

Performing EDA on the dataset and understanding how each of the attributes behave will help the company in reducing the risk of any loss.

#### Process followed:

1. Data Pre-processing <br>
   > - Fixing missing values
   > - Standardizing values
   > - Filtering data
   > - Deriving metrics
2. Data Analysis
   > - Univariate Analysis
   > - Segmented Univariate Analysis
   > - Bivariate Analysis
3. Conclusions from the Data Analysis

### The Dataset

The [dataset](www.example.com) used in this project contains information about past loan applicants and if they 'defaulted' or not.

## Conclusions

- Borrowers with lower annual income default more.
- Borrowers with a higher term tend to be defaulters more.
- Applications with a high DTI must be scrutinized before approval.
- The annual income and DTI of the loan applications with a higher loan amount must be verified before approval.
- Lowering the interest rate and the monthly installments increases the chances of the loan being fully paid back.
